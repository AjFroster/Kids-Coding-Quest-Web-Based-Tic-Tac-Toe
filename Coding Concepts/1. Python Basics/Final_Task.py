# Personal Information Dashboard Project

# Objective:
# To create a Python script that asks the user for various pieces of information (e.g., name, age, favorite colors, hobbies, etc.), stores this information in an organized manner, and displays a personalized dashboard summary at the end.

# Features:

#     User Greeting: Use variables and input to welcome the user and ask for their name.
#     Collect Personal Information: Ask for and store multiple pieces of data:
#         Age (with conversion from string to integer)
#         Favorite colors (using a list)
#         Hobbies (allowing multiple entries added to a list)
#     Educational Background: Use a dictionary to store information about the user's education, such as the name of their school and their favorite subject.
#     Summary Display: Use a loop and functions to display all collected information in a formatted summary.
#     Interactive Queries: Allow the user to input commands to view specific parts of their dashboard (e.g., "Show hobbies", "Show education").

# Implementation Steps:

#     Start with a greeting and collect basic information:
#         Use input to get the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
#     Age calculation:
#         Ask for the user's birth year, calculate their age, and store it.
#     Favorites Collection:
#         Use a loop to ask for their favorite colors and hobbies, storing each in its respective list.
#     Educational Background:
#         Create a dictionary to store educational details and populate it with user input.
#     Display Function:
#         Write a function to neatly print the user's information dashboard.
#     Interactive Part:
#         Implement a simple text-based menu that lets the user choose what information to display (e.g., typing "hobbies" shows the hobbies list).
#     Wrap Up:
#         End the program with a friendly message using the information provided.
